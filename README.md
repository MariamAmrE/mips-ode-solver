# ðŸ§® MIPS ODE Solver (First-Order ODE in MARS IDE)

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project is a MIPS 32-bit assembly implementation of a **first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver**, developed and tested using the **MARS IDE**. The program numerically approximates the solution of the ODE using methods such as **Eulerâ€™s Method** or a similar iterative technique.

It demonstrates how low-level programming and computer architecture concepts can be applied to solve mathematical problems typically handled in high-level languages.

## ðŸ§® Differential Equation

- The program solves the following **non-linear first-order ODE**:
dy/dx = 157xÂ² - 78x + 408yÂ³ - 34yÂ² - 28y - 16
- Helper function used:
F(x) = 157xÂ² - 78x + 408

# ðŸ“¥ Inputs
Passed to the program using MARS IDE pa option:

- y(0) â†’ initial value of y (float)

- h â†’ step size (float)

- n â†’ number of steps (integer)

# ðŸ“¤ Output
- Final y value after n steps is:

-- Stored in register $v0

-- Written to memory at address 0x10010000

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
