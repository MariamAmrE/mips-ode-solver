# mips-ode-solver
A MIPS 32-bit assembly program that solves a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) using numerical methods, written and simulated on the MARS IDE.

# ðŸ§® MIPS ODE Solver (First-Order ODE in MARS IDE)

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project is a MIPS 32-bit assembly implementation of a **first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver**, developed and tested using the **MARS IDE**. The program numerically approximates the solution of the ODE using methods such as **Eulerâ€™s Method** or a similar iterative technique.

It demonstrates how low-level programming and computer architecture concepts can be applied to solve mathematical problems typically handled in high-level languages.
